console.log(1);

  console.log(2);

Promise.resolve()

//   After reviewing the provided code, letâ€™s analyze the expected output together:

// The code contains a series of asynchronous operations. Despite the setTimeout being set to 0 milliseconds, the order of execution is influenced by how JavaScript handles different types of tasks in its event loop.

// console.log(1) is the first line of code, so it will be executed immediately, printing '1' to the console.
// The setTimeout with a callback function containing console.log(2) is set to 0 milliseconds. However, this doesn't mean it will execute immediately. Instead, it will be queued as a macrotask.
// The Promise with Promise.resolve() and two .then() handlers follows. These Promise-based operations are queued as microtasks.
// In the event loop, JavaScript prioritizes the execution of microtasks over macrotasks. So, after console.log(1), it will first process the microtask queue, which contains the Promise-based operations.

// Therefore, the output will be:

// 1
// 3
// 4
// 2
