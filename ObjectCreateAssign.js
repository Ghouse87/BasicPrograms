console.log(admin.verified, clone1.verified, clone2.verified);

// The admin object obviously has its verified property set to true because it uses the user as its 
// prototype. But, as you can see, none of the clones has the verified property. 
// This is because both the â€¦spread operator and Object.assign ignore the prototype when cloning.
